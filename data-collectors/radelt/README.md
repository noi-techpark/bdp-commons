local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:
- Everything inside [Open Data Hub Mobility - Data Collectors README](../../../../Desktop/bdp-commons/README.md#prerequisites)
- > **TODO** put your additional requisites here, do not add stuff that is already covered in the main README

### Configuration

> TODO: Write your data collector configuration descriptions here

### Additional information

> TODO: Add some additinal information, like what this DC does, how it works
> Talks also about the original data source and eventually provide links or
> documentation that describes the data that we retrieve
