# Vehicle Traffic Bluetooth

This data collector is meant to be the endpoint for all bluetooth-boxes spread
through the city and along the "strada statale" in proximity of the A22 highway.
It removes invalid records anonymizes the collected MAC-addresses, adds missing
metadata information and forwards it to the writer module of bdp-core.

[![CI vehicletraffic-bluetooth](https://github.com/noi-techpark/bdp-commons/actions/workflows/ci-vehicletraffic-bluetooth.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/noi-techpark/bdp-commons/actions/workflows/ci-vehicletraffic-bluetooth.yml)

## Prerequisists
- maven
- JDK 8

## Mac address hashing
All mac addresses send to this data collector are getting hashed with MD5.

## Endpoints

We have two paths currently, with a base at https://boxes.opendatahub.bz.it

### /json
Bluetooth boxes will connect to this endpoint, and push MAC addresses to it.

- `GET getLastRecord` gets the latest record timestamp of the given `station-id`
- `POST post` a list of `OddsRecordDto` from the `dc-interface/dto` package

### /trigger
This is the API hook for Google Spreadsheet to check for updates. Google will
call us, if the spreadsheet content changes.

## Metadata through Google Spreadsheet
The bluetooth boxes are missing some information like their actual position. To
add this information a google spreadsheet was created which in case of changes
triggers the update mechanism. This will retrieve all metadata of all stations
in the spreadsheet associate it with the box and synchronize with odh.

To open the spreadsheet, do:
- get the `spreadsheetId` from `src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/application.properties`
- go to: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[your-spreadsheet-id]`

### How does the spreadsheet work
The spreadsheet must have these 3 columns: `id`, `longitude`, `latitude`
- `id` must be unique and correspond the identifer (`stationcode`) of a
  `BluetoothStation`
- `longitude`, `latitude` need to be valid `EPSG:4326` cooridnates

Every additional column that gets created will be treated as metadata and added
to the metadata field.

Changes to the file will trigger an automatic synchronization of data.

## Installation
To get a first version of the datacollector running, you download the code,
configure the environment with the given property file, package the app and
deploy it on a java application server of your choice.

## Setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:noi-techpark/bdp-commons.git
cd data-collectors/vehicletraffic-bluetooth/

# set an encryption secret of your choice and change the other props if needed
vim src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/application.properties

# copy the client_secret.json file to src/main/resources/META-INF/spring
# copy the StoredCredential file to src/main/resources/META-INF/credentials
# (see https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides for details)

mvn package
cp target/[app].war [TOMCAT_HOME]/webapps
```

## Run Tests
To run tests just go to the project home folder and run `mvn test`. To also run
integration tests: `mvn verify`
